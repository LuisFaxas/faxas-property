## TECHNICAL DEBT & RISKS

### High Risk Issues
1. **No tests** - Any change could break system
2. **TypeScript 'any'** - Type safety compromised
3. **No file storage** - Core feature blocked
4. **Single tenant** - Can't scale to multiple companies
5. **No offline mode** - Field workers need this

### Medium Risk Issues
6. **No caching** - Performance will degrade
7. **No queue system** - Long operations block UI
8. **Inconsistent patterns** - Maintenance difficult
9. **No API versioning** - Breaking changes affect all
10. **Mock data in production code** - Confusion

### Technical Debt to Address
- Remove all mock data
- Standardize component patterns
- Add comprehensive testing
- Document all APIs
- Implement proper logging
- Add performance monitoring
- Create deployment automation

---

## RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

### Development Resources Needed
- **Backend Developer** - Complete APIs, integrations
- **Frontend Developer** - UI polish, mobile optimization  
- **UI/UX Designer** - Improve user experience
- **QA Tester** - Find and document bugs
- **DevOps Engineer** - Production infrastructure

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
- **Hosting** (Vercel/Railway): $50-200
- **Database** (Supabase): $25-100
- **Redis** (Upstash): $10-50
- **Storage** (S3/Cloudflare): $20-100
- **Email** (SendGrid): $20-50
- **Monitoring** (Sentry): $26-100
- **Total**: ~$150-600/month

### Timeline Reality Check
- **Current pace**: 1 developer
- **To complete MVP**: 3-4 months
- **To production ready**: 5-6 months
- **With team of 3**: 2-3 months

---

## CONCLUSION

The FAXAS Property Control Center has a solid foundation but significant gaps remain. The system is **65% complete** with critical features missing:

**Strengths:**
- Backend architecture solid
- Authentication/authorization working
- Core task management good
- Mobile components built

**Critical Gaps:**
- Budget system not industry standard
- No file management backend
- Contractor portal empty
- RFP/Bidding not implemented
- Mobile inconsistent

**Path Forward:**
1. Fix immediate blockers (APIs, file storage)
2. Rebuild budget to industry standards
3. Complete contractor portal
4. Implement RFP/Bidding
5. Polish and optimize for mobile
6. Deploy with production infrastructure

The system requires focused development to reach production readiness. With the current pace, expect 3-4 months to MVP, 5-6 months to production.
