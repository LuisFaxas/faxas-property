# Schedule Page Mobile Standards Update

## Summary
The Schedule page has been updated to use the new standardized mobile components, providing a consistent and polished mobile experience that matches the successful patterns from the Tasks page.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Replaced Dialogs with MobileDialog
- **Old**: Separate Dialog implementations for desktop/mobile with conditional rendering
- **New**: Single `MobileDialog` component that automatically adapts between desktop and mobile
- **Benefits**: Cleaner code, consistent behavior, automatic responsive adaptation

### 2. ✅ Created Mobile Event Components

#### EventForm Component (`components/schedule/mobile/event-form.tsx`)
- Reusable form component for creating/editing events
- Consistent styling with glass morphism effects
- Properly structured form fields with mobile-optimized inputs

#### EventCard Component (`components/schedule/mobile/event-card.tsx`)
- Swipeable card with gesture support
- **Right swipe**: Edit event
- **Left swipe**: Mark as complete (when not done)
- Visual indicators for event type and status
- Dimmed appearance for completed/canceled events
- Touch-optimized with proper spacing

#### EventDetailSheet Component (`components/schedule/mobile/event-detail-sheet.tsx`)
- Full event details in a bottom sheet on mobile
- Organized sections for easy scanning:
  - Description
  - Schedule (date & time)
  - Location
  - Attendees
  - Notes
- Action buttons for Edit, Complete, Cancel, Delete
- Status badge with appropriate colors

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Mobile Features

#### Toast Notifications
The page already uses the toast system for user feedback:
- Event created/updated/deleted confirmations
- Error messages for failed operations
- Success indicators for completions

#### Touch Optimization
- All touch targets are 48px minimum
- Swipe gestures for quick actions
- Pull-to-refresh ready (calendar view)
- Proper spacing between interactive elements

### 4. ✅ Code Organization
```
components/schedule/mobile/
├── event-form.tsx       # Reusable event form
├── event-card.tsx       # Swipeable event card
└── event-detail-sheet.tsx # Event detail view
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Event
```tsx
// Single MobileDialog works everywhere
<MobileDialog
  open={isCreateOpen}
  onOpenChange={setIsCreateOpen}
  title="Create Schedule Event"
  description="Add a new event to the project calendar"
>
  <EventForm formData={formData} onChange={setFormData} />
</MobileDialog>
```

### Displaying Events in List View
```tsx
// Mobile-optimized event cards with swipe actions
{events.map(event => (
  <EventCard
    key={event.id}
    event={event}
    onEdit={handleEdit}
    onComplete={handleComplete}
    onTap={handleShowDetails}
  />
))}
```

### Showing Event Details
```tsx
// Full event details in mobile-optimized sheet
<EventDetailSheet
  event={selectedEvent}
  isOpen={detailOpen}
  onClose={() => setDetailOpen(false)}
  onEdit={handleEdit}
  onDelete={handleDelete}
  onComplete={handleComplete}
/>
```

## Mobile Experience Improvements

### Before
- Separate dialog implementations causing inconsistency
- No swipe gestures for quick actions
- Basic table view on mobile
- Limited touch optimization

### After
- ✅ Universal MobileDialog adapts automatically
- ✅ Swipe gestures for edit/complete actions
- ✅ Touch-optimized event cards
- ✅ Full detail sheets with organized sections
- ✅ Consistent glass morphism styling
- ✅ Status indicators and visual hierarchy

   - Add progress indicators
   - Collapsible completed section

2. **Add pull-to-refresh**
