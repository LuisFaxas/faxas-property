# Token Management Fix - December 2024

## Issue
Users were experiencing "Token expired - please refresh your session" errors during normal usage, causing disruptions to their workflow.

## Root Cause
Firebase Authentication tokens expire after 1 hour, but the application wasn't proactively refreshing them, leading to failed API calls when tokens expired.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Proactive Token Refresh (AuthContext)
- **Automatic refresh every 50 minutes**: Tokens are refreshed 10 minutes before expiration
- **Visibility-based refresh**: When user returns to tab, checks if token needs refresh
- **Force fresh token on login**: Ensures users start with a new token
- **Improved error recovery**: Attempts to reload user and get new token on refresh failure

### 2. Intelligent Retry Logic (api-client.ts)
- **Automatic retry on 401 errors**: Up to 2 attempts with token refresh
- **Request tracking**: Prevents infinite retry loops with request ID mapping
- **Fallback strategies**:
  1. First attempt: Force token refresh
  2. Second attempt: Reload user and retry
  3. Final fallback: Show user-friendly message and redirect to login
- **User notifications**: Toast messages inform users of session issues

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- **Global toast listener**: Handles session expiration notifications app-wide
- **Graceful degradation**: Shows informative messages before forcing re-login
- **Delayed redirects**: Gives users time to see the message before redirect

## Technical Details

### Token Refresh Schedule
```
Token Lifetime: 60 minutes
Automatic Refresh: Every 50 minutes
Tab Focus Check: If < 10 minutes remaining
Retry on 401: Up to 2 attempts
```

### Files Modified
1. `app/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Added periodic token refresh interval
   - Added visibility change listener
   - Improved error handling with retry logic

2. `lib/api-client.ts`
   - Added retry attempt tracking
   - Implemented progressive retry strategy
   - Added user notification system

3. `components/providers/toast-listener.tsx` (new)
   - Global listener for custom toast events
   - Enables toast notifications from anywhere

4. `app/layout.tsx`
   - Added ToastListener component

## Benefits
- **Seamless experience**: Users stay logged in during active sessions
- **Automatic recovery**: Most token issues resolve without user intervention
- **Clear communication**: Users are informed when manual re-login is needed
- **Prevent data loss**: Retries ensure requests aren't lost due to temporary token issues

## Testing
The system now handles:
- Normal token expiration (after 1 hour)
- Tab switching/returning after being away
- Network interruptions during token refresh
- Multiple concurrent API calls with expired tokens

## Monitoring
Console logs provide visibility:
- "Token refreshed successfully at [timestamp]" - Regular refresh
- "Token expiring soon, refreshing..." - Tab visibility refresh
- "Token refresh attempt X for [request]" - Retry attempts
- "Token recovered after error" - Successful recovery
